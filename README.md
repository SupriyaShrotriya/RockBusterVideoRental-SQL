# RockBusterVideoRental-SQL
This SQL project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I analyzed the PostgreSQL sample database of a fictional DVD rental company.

## Project Summary

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, known for its extensive network of rental stores, is adapting to the streaming era by launching an online video rental service. The goal is to leverage existing movie licenses to remain competitive against major streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This project focuses on analyzing data to support the successful launch and ongoing strategy of this new streaming service.

## Key Questions

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

- What was the average rental duration for all videos?

- Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue gain?

- Do sales figures vary between geographical regions?

- In which countries are Rockbuster’s customers based?

- Where are customers with a high lifetime value located?

- What movie genres generate the most revenue?

## Data & Tools

Rockbuster relational database management system and Postgre SQL was used for the analysis purpose. The data set includes information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history and addresses.
